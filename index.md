## Banyan Logic, LLC
Banyan Logic is based out of Oakton, VA, USA. We pivoted to knowledge sharing as our main focus, instead of classes or consulting services. Please enjoy our insights section as and when your time permits. In past, we provide Automation Lifecycle specialist (C) training for qualified individuals. Upon request, we can also provide Cyber Security training, process automation training, and auditing training, for securing business solutions.

## Automation Lifecycle specialist (C) training
The nocode/lowcode movement creates positive and negative risks. On the positive side, agility to create solutions is much higher. On the negative side, agility to push out mistake, errors, and even vulnerabilities is much higher as well. We aim to help individuals learn both what to do and what not to do. Studnets build multi-lifecycle sample deliverables, such as a Business Requirements Document and an actual Microsoft PowerPlatform Canvas App, first in a Business Analyst's role and the next in a Functional Consultant role, but both delivered with a Security Analyst mind set. It is a career oriented training not specific to today's one job. It is a fun journey and a profitable one for our students, and us.
