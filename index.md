## Banyan Logic, LLC
Banyan Logic is an education firm headquartered in Oakton, VA, USA. We provide Secure Business Solutions Maker (C) certification for qualified individuals. Upon request, we can also provide Cyber Security training, process automation training, and auditing training, for securing business solutions.

Secure Business Solutions Maker (C) certificate
The nocode/lowcode movement creates positive and negative risks. On the positive side, agility to create solutions is much higher. On the negative side, agility to push out mistake, errors, and even vulnerabilities is much higher as well. We aim to help individuals learn both what to do and what not to do. Studnets build multi-lifecycle sample deliverables, such as a Business Requirements Document and an actual Microsoft PowerPlatform Canvas App, first in a Business Analyst's role and the next in a Functional Consultant role, but both delivered with a Security Analyst mind set. It is a career oriented training not specific to today's one job. It is a fun journey and a profitable one for our students, and us.
