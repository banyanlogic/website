## A.R.T. and Security &copy;
## A.R.T. and IT &copy;
### Purpose
The foundation of problem-solving is knowing whose problem we are trying to solve and what are the factors that play into the problem on an ongoing basis. Therefore, a 360-degree scorecard is needed to evaluate an IT Organization or SME relatability for the organizations and individuals we provide services to. The A.R.T.* scorecards serve this purpose, and the basis described below using security as an example. It is human-centric, design-thinking inspired method. I am an active user of it, and I use it to set my learning targets and evaluate the outcome of any given problem or vulnerability.

I look forward to your comments on this topic and usage over LinkedIn @ <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/skasturi">http://www.linkedin.com/in/skasturi</a>

### Description
The Absolute, Relative and Transactional (A.R.T.) friction factors can make or break Security. Consider these cause and effect relationships:
* Absolute Friction: Occurs and snowballs when the stakeholders of a business or organization are not heard or understood, or when the security group is not heard or understood. The effect is the irrelevancy of the security group.
* Relative Friction: Occurs and snowballs when there is a process disconnect. The effect is the inefficiency of the entire organization or business.
* Tactile Friction: Occurs and snowballs when the stakeholder's or security groupâ€™s technology is not mutually understood in detail. The effect is insufficient automation.

### Evaluation tool
Method to assess A.R.T. score is based on weighted key 'empathy' attributes for each of the lifecycles that impact and are impacted by security activities. <a href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=sCcL4y7YvESdCVcMcTuu4OIitblMf7hIhnaXAD0Y67FUQk1DUUIxNTFPTDRTMDdMTlkxOEtTVTRIVy4u" target="_blank">Here is the link to the latest A.R.T. and Security (c) Coarse Grain Score v1 calculator form</a>. A more detailed calculator will be released soon. You can always find link to the latest score card here.
